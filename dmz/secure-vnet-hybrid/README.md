# DMZ between Azure and your on-premises datacenter

This reference architecture shows a secure hybrid network that extends an on-premises network to Azure. The architecture implements a DMZ, also called a perimeter network, between the on-premises network and an Azure virtual network (VNet). The DMZ includes an Azure Firewall, a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects the Azure Virtual Network resources. All outgoing traffic from the VNet is force-tunneled to the Internet through the on-premises network, so that it can be audited.

For deployment instructions and guidance about best practices, see the article [DMZ between Azure and your on-premises datacenter](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/dmz/secure-vnet-hybrid) on the Azure Architecture Center.

The deployment uses [Azure Building Blocks](https://github.com/mspnp/template-building-blocks/wiki) (azbb), a command line tool that simplifies deployment of Azure resources.
